Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning on CLAMP Dataset


## Introduction
Malicious programs or malware is an intentionally written program to indulge in various malicious activities, ranging from stealing userâ€™s information to 
cyber-espionage. The behavioral dynamism exposed by the malware is dependent on various factors such as nature of the attack, sophisticated technology and 
the rapid increase in exploitable vulnerabilities. Malware attacks also increased along with the rapid growth in the use of digital devices and internet. 
The exponential increase in the creation of new malware in the last five years has made malware detection a challenging research issue.
